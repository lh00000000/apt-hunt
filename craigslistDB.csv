662 jamaica ave,"Looking for someone who is CLEAN to share a large 4 bedroom apartment with 2 other people. I am a young professional male in my mid 20s and work a 9-5 job in the Financial district. I am up by 6:00AM every day and return around 6:00PM. My parents got divorced a couple years ago, and my mother has been living with me ever since. She works 7 days a week and is gone most of the day.   There is an empty room with no window that I am currently using as storage. It has a large walk in closet, and is big enough to fit a queen sized bed (included). It also has a small flat screen TV. This room is about 11x13 feet.  The other room is smaller (twin size bed), and has a large window facing the front of the street. This room is currently occupied but my roommate is leaving at the beginning of October. This room comes with a mini fridge, dresser, and twin sized bed. It is about 8x11 feet.  You would choose either of these 2 rooms for $600 per month. We would split the utilities (wifi, electricity, gas). I will later either rent out the remaining room, or use it as an office.  This is a very boring and drama free apartment . We do not throw parties, and the neighborhood is very quiet.   I am looking for somebody who is CLEAN(I cannot emphasize this enough) and who either works full time or goes to school full time.  To move in you must have 1st month's rent, and a $400 security deposit, at least 2 references from people you lived with before, proof of income and willingness to submit to a credit and background check.

66 Washington Avenue,"A condo loft with ""open"" layout near Steiner Studios and the Brooklyn Navy Yard to share. It is on the third floor; there is no elevator.  There are two large open rooms to share with a total of 11 windows, 14' ceiling, 2 HVAC units (heat & AC), a new kitchen with granite counter-tops and gas range, 50 MB WiFi, clothes washer/dryer, etc.  The main room contains a kitchen, dining area, and an office.  The second room (on a corner with 7 windows, see attached pictures) has a TV (no cable but great reception), a living room area with 9'x7' L-shaped sofa. There's a double bed in the corner where I sleep, and the sofa opens into a double bed for you. I'm only in this room to sleep (and to watch Jets and Giants) and I get up very early. There's a door so it would be pretty private for you. But please understand: THERE IS NO SEPARATE/PRIVATE BEDROOM. (And I'll still get people asking where the bedroom is.)  I own the building and I am flexible on rent. Every situation is different, factors include are you a student or professional person with a solid income; will you be using the loft as a live/work space; etc. Money is not the deciding factor but it is not irrelevant since I hope to visit Paris for a month in the Fall and it would give me extra spending money. The market value of the loft is $4,500/month; the range I'm asking for the share is between $1,000/month to $400/month. That includes everything.  I'm not desperate for a room-mate, and the situation is not right for everybody. Please do not waste my time or yours if the concept is not comfortable for you. Two recent shares were pleasant experiences, so I figure I'll try again.  I'm a guy who's worked a wide variety of jobs, including teaching at the Police university in Beijing, where I also owned a restaurant. I still occasionally work in films in China. I can be outgoing or quiet depending on the circumstances; am quite comfortable keeping to myself.  No bringing the party home: i.e., no guests, for me or for you.   The space is available for share for as short a time as a week or indefinitely.  AVAILABLE NOW.

144 Spencer St.,"Hello people,   So we have an amazing room open for availability November 1st in Bedstuy, Brooklyn. We are preferably looking for a MALE roommate. Rent is $700 a month with a small utility bill. It's pretty large and you can modify it to your liking (painting the walls if you like, adding more lighting, etc). There are built in shelves into the walls so you wouldn't even need to bring furniture, but there is plenty of room if you have it. Theres also a loft space that can be used for some things of yours in the room as well. There is currently a Queen size bed in the room with plenty more room for a desk, a nightstand, or a clothes rack. This room has no windows but is still a steal because of the price and size.You would be in the largest bedroom which is right across from the bathroom. This is a large 3 bedroom loft apartment with 1 bathroom. There is an elevator and a freight elevator as well. The apartment is on the third floor. There is also a laundry room on every floor. There is a grocery store right below which is very clutch at times. Also, alot of great restaurants and some great watering holes down Myrtle Ave. We never have issues with any of our neighbors. In fact everyone in the building is awesome and nice. The nearest trains are the G - Bedford or G - Myrtle Willoughby.  So here is some info on who you will be living with.  We are all in our late twenties. One room is occupied by a couple (my boyfriend and I). The other room is occupied by another male who occasionally plays his acoustic guitar. The dudes are both bartenders and pretty much live on a nightlife schedule. I work in fashion and do alot of freelance work. Which means we are usually all home during the day and go out at night. But it varies from time to time. Other times we are all home cooking, drinking, playing video games. Also very 420 friendly. We do not mind if you do not participate but MUST be okay with it. Also you will be living with two fur roommates that go by the name of Rashad and Maggie, a young tuxedo kitten duo who are very loving and silly. They are very well behaved and love chatting with you.  We are not about ""checking in"" or telling you lights out at a certain time. We all come and go as we please. We are all (fun) adults who live our own lives and are just looking for someone who is on our same wave length when it comes to living. Just a clean, NICE, responsible person who will pay their bills on time. If this sounds like you reply and we can schedule a viewing.
